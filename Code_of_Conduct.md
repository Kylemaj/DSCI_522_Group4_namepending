# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

The MDS program is composed of individuals who have made a tremendous commitment of time, finances and energy in order to develop themselves as data science professionals. While we share many similarities in terms of work ethic, talent and commitment, we also have many differences stemming from our background, culture and individual experiences. The purpose of this code of conduct is to allow everybody involved to get the full value of this experience. The below guidelines should serve as a framework for internal and external group interactions that ensures we are all able to succeed and grow together in a positive and respectful space. 

## Principals & Expectations

- **Respect:** All interactions are to be conducted in a respectful and professional manner. 
- **Honesty:** Communicate with transparency and integrity.
- **Openness:** Everybody comes from a different backgrounds and has a unique perspective. Be mindful that there can be many different but equally valid viewpoints on an issue.
- **Constructive Criticism:** Feedback is a necessary part of any project. However, it must be offered and received in good faith.
- **Professionalism:** Conduct yourself as a business professional.
- **Collaboration:** While it may not always feel like it, the purpose of this program is not for us to complete assignments, it is for us to learn. Group members should be mindful of this when deciding how to delegate tasks. Milestones are to be completed in such a way that each group member has a reasonable technical and conceptual understanding of every deliverable. It is not acceptable for a single group member to "carry the team" in the interest of time, or for a single group member to hand off their responsibilities to the rest of the team.

### Inappropriate Behavior

- Sexually explicit language or imagery including unwanted sexual advances.
- Retaining and or disclosing the personal information of others without explicit permission.
- Deliberately insulting or patronizing comments.
- Uninvited commentary or criticism of personal beliefs.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all group or individual interactions and communications associated with the DSCI 522 course. This extends to in-person as well as virtual settings.
