# Team Contract

## Expectations

Group members will determine and assign deliverables during the first meeting of each week. Group members are expected to manage their time accordingly to have all assigned deliverables complete at least 6 hours before each milestone deadline (Nov 17, Dec 4, Dec 11 and Dec 18). If a group member feels they will be unable to complete their assigned deliverables to a satisfactory quality by the deadline, they are expected to notify the group in slack at least 24 hours before said deadline so that a response plan can be established.
All submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the milestones as set out in the instructions. This includes making sure all scripts are working, creating tests for all your functions, and using proper grammar in written submissions.

## Meetings

Meeting times were established during the initial team meeting held on 17 November 2021. Meetings will be held in or outside of ESB 2012 on the following dates:

- Monday 11/22: 12-2 PM
- Wednesday 11/24: 2-4 PM
- Monday 11/29: 12-2 PM
- Wednesday 12/1: 2-4 PM 
- Monday 12/6: 12-2 PM
- Wednesday 12/8: 2-4 PM
- Monday 12/13: 12-2 PM
- Wednesday 12/15: 2-4 PM

All members are expected to attend the meetings. If a member cannot make a meeting, written notice must be given 24 hours before the meeting to discuss alternative options.

## Communication

All communication outside of the meetings will be through Slack or Github. Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work. Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings.

## Reviews

All members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com. Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to have all pull request reviewed by another teammate. Pull requests should be reviewed within 24 hours after creation.

## Roles

There are two roles team members will be responsible for each week. The roles are as follows:
Scribe:
- Responsible for recording minutes for the groups meetings as well as important information/announcements given in lectures.
- Responsible for making these notes available to group members.
Reviewer:
- Responsible for doing a final check of the submission before the deadline to make sure all requirements are satisfied.

Each week one member will be assigned as scribe and two will be assigned as reviewers.

## Deadlines

As outlined in expectations, responsibilities and deadlines for individual items will be assigned during meetings. The reviewers will:
review the work on Saturday and ensure that the final version is ready for submission
create the required version tag.

## Breach of Contract

Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:
1. The first step is a written communication that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
2. The second step is a meeting to discuss the behaviour and ensure that the expectations of the team contract are clear.
3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs for mediation.
